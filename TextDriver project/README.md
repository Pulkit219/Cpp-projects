# Text Menu driver
This individual project helped me learn the following topics
* Copy constructor with deep copies
* Overloading operator
* Passing by reference function
* Creating and managing dynamic allocation on heap explicitly.
* Custom implementation of stack data structure

This program has 2 class Text and Menu with MenuDriver having main().
Text class will have text having list of options, while
Menu class will display those options
* User can select, remove and add an option.

* **Bonus**# Use can remove and add an option at specific index if any index exists.

* NOTE## try/catch exception handling is not included with this project.
